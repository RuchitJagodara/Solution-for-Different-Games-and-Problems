# Connect-4-game

A fully functional connect 4 game. In this you can play with the compute, and I can bet that you won't be able to win against the computer if you are going second ðŸ˜‰, and if you manage to beat the computer, I'm not just leaving you hanging! Slide into my DMs, and I'll treat you to something special. It's not every day you outsmart a machine, right?

## Implemetation

I implemented this connect 4 game using the DFS algorithm for graph traversal, which goes through every possible permutations of the moves and then it finds the best possible move for that particular situation of board. And with the help of memoization it stores the best move for every node which it has visited so next time when player makes any move program will play its move instantly (here node mean the situation of the board).
