# TicTacToe-game

Tic-Tac-Toe ! Ya, you heard it, right. The game which we played a lot while we were children(during the lecture time ðŸ˜… ). Now, why don't you try out a new version of that? In this repo, you can find the code of modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe, this allows you to change the size of the board and total number of 'x' or 'o' in a continuous sequence to win the game.


# Algorithm 

This code is based on the DFS (Depth First Search) of graph traversal which goes through all possible situations and gives the best possible move on that situation. I bet you can't win in this game (if you are going second) and if you manage to do so without changing the code :) , just DM me, will give you a treat ðŸ˜ƒ.
