# n Queens Problem 

In this folder, you will find the solution for the classical n Queens Problem which was first proposed by the German chess enthusiast Max Bezzel for the standard 8*8 board.
Also solution of this problem is attached as a c++ code file.

# Problem statement 

You have to place n queens on a n*n chessboard so that no two queens are attacking each other, where n is a positive integer.
Here, this means that no two queens should be on the same raw, same column or same diagonal.
We have to take the value of n as input and then we have to output a chess board with queens placed on squares so that it satisfies the above condition.
